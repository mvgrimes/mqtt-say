- better voices? festival/google tts
- pause squeezeplayer

- had to create /etc/asound.conf to avoid espeak errors like:
  ALSA lib pcm.c:2501:(snd_pcm_open_noupdate) Unknown PCM cards.pcm.modem
  Might also need jackd (very poor voices, though)

- festival has better voices, but takes 20s to create wav
